The amount of published Linked Data on the Web is increasing day by day.
As a result, the applications driven by Semantic Web and Linked Data are taking momentum on the Web.
One of the major entrance barriers for Web developers to contribute to this wave of Linked Data Applications (LDAs) is the required knowledge of Semantic Web technologies such as RDF data model and SPARQL query language to interact with the triple stores.
This paper presents an adaptive component-based approach together with its open source implementation for creating flexible and resuable Semantic Web interfaces driven by Linked Data.
Linked Data-driven (LD-R) Web components abstract the complexity of underlying Semantic Web technologies in order to allow reuse of existing Web components in LDAs and to enable Web developers who are not expert in Semantic Web to develop interfaces to view, edit and browse Linked Data.
In addition to modularity provided by the LD-R components, the proposed RDF-based configuration method allows application assemblers to reshape their user interface for different use cases, by either reusing existing shared configurations or by creating their proprietary configurations.

With the growing number of structured data published on the Web, WWW is moving towards becoming a rich ecosystem of machine-understandable Linked Data (LD)~\footnote{\url{lodlaundromat.org} recently (25.09.2015) reported approx. 38.6 billion triples published on the Web.}.
Semantically structured data facilitate a number of important aspects of
information management such as information retrieval, search, visualization,  customization, personalization and integration~\cite{SCAJ-Khalili-2013}.
Despite all these benefits, Linked Data Applications (LDAs) have not yet grasped well by the large community of Web developers outside the Semantic Web domain and causally, by the end users on the Web.
%can we add some evidence?
The usage of semantic data is still quite limited and most of the currently published Linked Data are generated by a relatively small amount of publishers~\cite{ontowiki-swj} which indicate some entrance barriers towards wide-spread utilization of Linked Data~\cite{StegemannZ14}.

%describe issues
The current communication gap between Semantic Web developers and User Experience (UX) designers, driven by the need to bear Semantic Web knowledge, prevents streamline flow of best practices from UX community into the Linked Data user interfaces (UIs).
The resulting lack of adoption and standardization makes current LDAs not often function consistent with user expectations and impels more development time and costs on LDA deveopers.
In this situation, more time is spent in re-designing existing UIs rather than focusing on innovation and creation of sophisticated LDAs.
 
This paper presents adaptive Linked Data-driven Web components as an approach to build flexible and reusable Semantic Web UIs.
\emph{Web Components} are a set of W3C standards~\cite{webcomponentsW3C} that enable the creation of reusable widgets or components in Web documents and Web applications.
Resource Description Framework (RDF), on the other hand, provides a common data model that allows data-driven components to be created, shared and integrated in a structured way across different applications.
Linked Data-driven (LD-R) Web components as defiend in this paper are a species of Web components that employ RDF data model for representing their content and specification (i.e. metadata about the component).
LD-R components are supported by a set of predefined core Web components each representing a compartment of the RDF data model on the Web UI.
LD-R components enable encapsualtion of the Semantic Web nature of an LDA thereby allow UX designers and Web developers outside the Semantic Web community to contribute to LDAs.
They also allow current Semantic Web developers to reuse existing Web components in their LDAs.
Furthermore, LD-R components exploit the power and flexibility of RDF data model in describing and sharing resources to provide a mechanism to adapt the Web interfaces based on the meaning of data and user-defined rules. 
%The RDF (Resource Description Framework) as the basic building block of the Semantic Web provides a general framework to describe resources on the Web.

LD-R approach offers many benefits that we will describe in the remainder of the paper. Among them are:

\paragraph{Bootstrapping LDA UIs} 
LD-R components exploit best practices from modern Web application development to bring an exhaustive architecture to perform separation of concerns and thereby bootstrapping an LDA by only selecting a minimal relavant configuration.
For example, a developer only needs to set the URL of his in-use SPARQL endpoint and start developing the viewer components without dealing with the underlying connection adapters and data flow mediators in the system.

\paragraph{Standardization and Reusability of LDA UIs} 
Instead of creating an LDA UI from the scratch, in the component-based development of LDA UIs, application assemblers choose from a set of standard UIs which will reduce the time and costs associated with creation of LDAs.
For example, to render DBpedia resource of type 'Location', a standard map can be reused.

\paragraph{Customization and Personalization of LDA UIs} 
RDF-based nature of LD-R components allow application assemblers to reshape their user interface based on the meaning of data or user context.
For example, for all the resources of type 'foaf:Person', the content can be rendered with a 'ContactCard' component.

\paragraph{Adoption of LDA UIs by non-Semantic Web developers and end-users} 
Abstracting the complexity of RDF and graph-based data representation, provides more \emph{Affordances}~\cite{Norman2013} for non-Semantic Web users to contribute to Linked Data UIs.
Engaging more UX designers and Web developers into LDA UIs will also result in more affordances on the end-user's side to better understand the possible actions and advantages of the LDAs.

\section{Contributions and Outline}
The contributions of this work are the concept of \emph{Adaptive LD-R Web components} and an open source implementation of it available at \url{http://ld-r.org}.
Our primary claim is that adopting a component-based approach that encapsualtes the main concerns of a Semantic Web application, paves the way to reuse existing best practices from the UX community within the LDAs hence building more usable and pervasive LDAs.

We explore this claim in stages.
First, we collect some data about the current status of Semantic Web UI development.
Next, we demonstrate how adaptive LD-R Web components can address the current issues in LDA UI development.
Finally, we discuss the implementation of our idea and its usage in real-world scenarios.

\section{The Current Status of Linked Data User Interface Development}
In order to understand the current pitfalls of LDA UI design, we conducted a survey targeting \textbf{67} active Semantic Web developers~\footnote{results are available at \url{https://goo.gl/cltqhv}}.
The participants where selected from the community of Semantic Web developers on Github who have had at least one active Semantic Web-related repository.
We used Github APIs~\footnote{\url{https://developer.github.com/v3/}} to search~\footnote{keywords: "Semantic Web" OR "Linked Data" OR "RDF" OR "SPARQL"} for the potential Semantic Web repositories and then collect the contact information of the corresponding contributors when available.
The search, after removing the organizations and invalid email addresses, resulted in 650 potential Semantic Web developers.
We then contacted the potential candidates to ask them about the current pitfalls in developing LDA UIs.
In our enquiry, we clearly mentioned to skip the questionnaire if they have not developed any Semantic Web developers so far.
We used a set of 7 minimal viable questions to attract more people and also used inline forms for GMail users to allow filling out the questionnaire in the same time that reading the enquiry email.
The number of participants who filled out our questionnaire at the end was 67 (10.3\% of the potential candidates).
Questions addressed the following topics:

\paragraph{Knowldge of Semantic Web and Experience in developing LDAs}

\paragraph{Amount of time spent on bootstraping LDA UIs}

\paragraph{Reuse of code by Semantic Web developers}

\paragraph{Adoption of current Web Components by Semantic Web developers}

\paragraph{Issues with non-Semantic Web developers to create LDA UIs}

\section{Adaptive Linked Data-driven Web Components}
In order to streamline the process of UI development in LDAs, we propose an architecture of adaptive LD-R components -- Web components enriched by the RDF data model.
In the following sections, the main elements of the architecture are described:

\subsection{LD-R Web Components}
AS depicted in \autoref{fig:architecture}, there are 4 main component levels in an LD-R Web application.
Each core component abstracts the actions required for retrieving and updating the graph-based data and provides a basis for user-defined components to interact with Linked Data in three modes: view, edit and browse.
For example, a viewer in the level of Dataset component can enable visualizing a set of resources based on a certain property value whereas a viewer in the level of Resource component can only allow visualizing properties of a specific resource (or a specific type of resource).

The dataflow in the application starts from the \emph{Dataset} component which handles all the events related to a set of resources under a named graph identified using a URI.
The next level is the \emph{Resource} component which is identified by a URI and indicates what is described in the application.
A resource is specified by a set of properties which are handled by the \emph{Property} component. 
Properties can be either individual or aggregate when combining multiple features of a resource (e.g. a component that combines longitude and latitude properties; start data and end date properties for a date range, etc.).
Each property is instantiated by an individual value or mutiple values in case of an aggreagte object. 
The value(s) of properties are controled by the \emph{Value} component.
Value component invokes different components to view, edit and browse the property values.
\emph{Viewer}, \emph{Editor} and \emph{Browser} components are terminals in the LD-R single directional data flow where customized user-generated components can be plugged into the system.
These components apply on individual and aggregate values (e.g. to show multiple coordinates on a the map).

\begin{figure}[tb]
  \includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{images/microservices.jpg}
  \caption{Monoliths vs. Microservices~\cite{microservices}}
  \label{fig:microservices}
\end{figure}

In contrast to the centalized monolithic architecture, LD-R components comply with \emph{Microservices Architecture}~\cite{microservices}.
As shown in \autoref{fig:microservices}, microservices architecture puts the main functionalities of a component into separete services (instead of in-memory function calls) and scales by distributing these services across servers, replicating as needed.
This architectural style minimizes the redeploying of the entire application when changes in components occure.

\subsection{Scopes and Configurations}

\begin{figure}[tb]
  \includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{images/scopes.jpg}
  \caption{LD-R scopes based on the combination of dataset, resource, property and value identifiers.}
  \label{fig:scopes}
\end{figure}

LD-R provide a versatile approach for context adaptation.
A context can be a specific domain of interest, a specific user requirment or both.
In order to enable customization and personalization, LD-R exploits the concept of \emph{Scope}.
A scope is defiened as a directed combination of Dataset, Resource, Property and Value components (cf. \autoref{fig:scopes}).
Each scope conveys a certain level of specificity on a given context ranging from 1 (most specific) to 15 (least specfic).
Scopes are defined by using either the URIs of named graphs, resources and properties; or by identifying the resource types and data types.
UI adaptation is handled by traversing the configs for scopes and overwriting the configs when a more specific scope is found.
For example, on the property level, we can define a generic configuration for all properties and then for some specific properties (e.g. dcterms:title, rdfs:label) within a specific resource (e.g. <http://ld-r.org>), we can change those configurations using the RP scope.
Another example would be having a different rendering for all resources of a specific type (e.g. foaf:Person).

Scopes can also be defined under a specific user which facilitates versioning and reuse of user-specific configs.
User-specifc configs provide different views on components and thereby data, based on the different personas dealing with those components and data.

In addition to the fine-grained component customization, LD-R Web applications provide a fine-grained access control over the data provided by the components.
RDF-based access control in LD-R applications operates at four different granularities provided by the Dataset, Resource, Property and Value component levels and scopes.
For example, application developer can restrict access to a specific property of a specific resource in a certain dataset.

\subsection{Stackeholders and Life Cycle}
\begin{figure}[tb]
  \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/lifecycle.jpg}
  \caption{LD-R components life cycle.}
  \label{fig:lifecycle}
\end{figure}

As shown in \autoref{fig:lifecycle}, the LD-R components lifecycle encompasses four primary types of stakeholders:

\begin{itemize}

\item \emph{Linked Data Provider}.
Since the LD-R approach focuses mainly on Linked Data applications, provision of RDF-compliant data is an essential phase in developing the LD-R components.
*Data Scientists and different steps in providing fata from LOD2 project

\item \emph{Component Developer}. 
It includes programmers who are involved in component fabrication.


\item \emph{Application Assembler}.
The main task of application assembler is to identify the right components and configurations for the application; and combine them in a way which fits the application requirement. 

\item \emph{End User}. 
It is the user who experiences working with components to pursue his goals on a certain application domain.
The end user is the one who requests developing a component and the one who sends feedback on the existing components.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Separation of Concerns}
*categorize technical aspects

*need for a framework to bootstrap LDA UIs, talk about different concerns in LDAs already implemented in LD-R


\section{Implementation}

Component content represented in RDFa, Microdata. exmaple: good relations for online shopping and SEO

metadata about components (https://github.com/ali1k/ld-r-metadata-generator) in JSON-LD

general metadata: name, description, version, homepage, author, etc.

specific metadata: level, granularity (individual, aggregate), mode (view, edit, browse), dependencies (internal, external), config parameters with description

use Schema.org SoftwareApplication schema.

In order to realize the idea of Linked Data-driven Web components, we implemented a software framework called \emph{Linked Data Reactor (LD-R)} which is available online at \url{http://ld-r.org}.
LD-R utilizes Facebook's ReactJS\footnote{\url{https://facebook.github.io/react/}} components and Flux\footnote{\url{https://facebook.github.io/flux}} architecture, Yahoo!'s Fluxible\footnote{\url{http://fluxible.io/}} framework for isomorphic Web applications and Semantic-UI\footnote{\url{http://semantic-ui.com/}} framework for flexible UI themes.


\begin{figure}[tb]
  \includegraphics[width=.9\linewidth]{images/dataflow.jpg}
  \caption{Data flow in the Linked Data Reactor framework.}
  \label{fig:dataflow}
\end{figure}

The main reasons we chose \emph{React} components over other existing solutions (e.g. Polymer\footnote{\url{http://www.polymer-project.org/}}, AngularJS\footnote{\url{https://angularjs.org/}}, EmberJS\footnote{\url{http://emberjs.com/}}, etc.) were the maturity of the technology, maintainablity, number of developer tools/components/applications, and efficiency\footnote{Elaborating on all these factors is beyond the scope of this paper.}.
As shown in \autoref{fig:dataflow}, LD-R follows the Flux architecture which eschews MVC (Model-View-Controller) in favor of a unidirectional data flow. 
When a user interacts with a React component, the component propagates an action through a central dispatcher, to the various stores that hold the application's data and business logic, which updates all of the components that are affected. 
The component interaction with SPARQL endpoints to retrieve and update Linked Data occurs via invoking RESTful services in actions.

\section{Conclusion}
Web components aim to bring \emph{Component-Based Software Development} (CBSD) to the World Wide Web.
Some advantages of CBSD approach are reusibility, replacability, extensibility, encapsulation and independence.
LD-R approach not only facilitates the discovery and reuse of Web components but also makes the creation of Linked Data application easier.
